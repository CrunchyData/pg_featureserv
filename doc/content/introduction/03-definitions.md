# Definitions or Needed Concepts

- Define important terms (e.g. "Ansible roles"). The definition should be as short and simple as possible. If you think the reader might benefit from a more in-depth explanation, find an existing resource or page; if there are none, that might be a good opportunity to write a separate short article or blog post.
- If there is a chance that the reader might not be familiar with any acronyms or abbreviations, write out the term in full here, accompanied by the shortened version that would be used throughout the rest of the doc.  
- Include prerequisite skills or knowledge level.
  - If they donâ€™t have these prerequisites, how and where can readers acquire them?
  - Link out to other learning material (example: [Introduction to PostGIS](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/introduction.html))
