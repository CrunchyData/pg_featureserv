# Common Tasks  

- Describe a few tasks that may be commonly carried out by any reader.
  - Getting the Support teamâ€™s input might be helpful here.
  - If a lot of common tasks revolve around troubleshooting, write a separate Troubleshooting section.
- Order the tasks from least to most complex.
- If the order of a list of items does not matter, use bullet points (Example: a list of variables). Otherwise, use a numbered list.
  - If there are more than 5 bullet points, consider a table display.
- Also consider breaking out each step into subsections. Each subsection heading can include the step number.
