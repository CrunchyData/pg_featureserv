# Basic Usage  

(may be covered in Deployment)

- Describe a standard task or use case step by step.
- If the order of a list of items does not matter, use bullet points (Example: a list of variables). Otherwise, use a numbered list.
  - If there are more than 5 bullet points, consider a table display.
- Also consider breaking out each step into subsections. Each subsection heading can include the step number.
