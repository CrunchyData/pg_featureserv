# Advanced Usage (optional)  

- Describe a more complex or nuanced use case for the product that could still be applicable to more than one customer or organization.
  - Getting the Support teamâ€™s input might be helpful here.
- If the order of a list of items does not matter, use bullet points (Example: a list of variables). Otherwise, use a numbered list.
  - If there are more than 5 bullet points, consider a table display.
- Also consider breaking out each step into subsections. Each subsection heading can include the step number.
