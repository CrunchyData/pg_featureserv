# Deployment  

- Are there scenarios in which the deployment steps would vary? Break this section out into subsections, or pages if necessary.
  - Each subsection heading can include the step number, for clarity.
- If the order of a list of items does not matter, use bullet points (Example: a list of variables). Otherwise, use a numbered list.
  - If there are more than 5 bullet points, consider a table display.
