This section describes how to obtain, install and run `pg_featureserv`.

## Requirements

* **PostgreSQL 9.5** or later
* **PostGIS 2.4** or later

You don't need advanced knowledge in Postgres/PostGIS or web mapping to install and deploy `pg_featureserv`. If you are new to functions in Postgres, you might try this [quick interactive course](https://learn.crunchydata.com/postgresql-devel/courses/beyond-basics/basicfunctions/) to better see how you might take advantage of `pg_featureserv`'s capabilities.

We also link to [further resources](/learn-more/) at the end of this guide, for your reference.
