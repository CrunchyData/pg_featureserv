## Basic operation

The service can be run with minimal configuration.
Only the database connection information is required.
(The only situtation when this is not needed is when
running with the `--test` option.)

The database connection information can be provided in an environment variable
`DATABASE_URL` containing a Postgres [connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).
It can also be provided in the configuration file `DbConnection` parameter.

### Linux or OSX
```sh
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host/dbname
./pg_featureserv
```

### Windows
```
SET DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host/dbname
pg_featureserv.exe
```
