Non-spatial functions (i.e. functions that don't return spatial data) can also be accessed via `pg_featureserv`, as long as they are published in the `postgisftw` schema.

The following function example can be used with the `ne.countries` collection created in the [Quick Start](/quickstart/) section. It shows a function that accepts longitude and latitude values, and returns the corresponding country (if any). Unlike the other function examples in this section, it does not return a table with a geometry type column.

Any kind of function in the `postgisftw` schema is published, which allows you even more flexible access to data. You can create functions that return statistics, summary records, populate dropdown lists or autocomplete suggestions, and more.

## Create a non-spatial function that locates the country for a given coordinate pair

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION postgisftw.country_by_loc(
  lon numeric DEFAULT 0.0,
  lat numeric DEFAULT 0.0)
RETURNS TABLE(name text, abbrev text, postal text)
AS $$
BEGIN
     RETURN QUERY
   SELECT c.name::text, c.abbrev::text, c.postal::text
   FROM ne.countries c
   WHERE ST_Intersects(c.geom,
            ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(lon, lat), 4326))
   LIMIT 1;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql' STABLE STRICT;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION postgisftw.country_by_loc
IS 'Finds the country at a geographic location';
```

Notes:

* The function generates a [Point](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakePoint.html) based on the longitude and latitude values provided in the parameters.
* The `ne.countries` table is filtered based on whether the point [intersects](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersects.html) a country polygon.
* It's possible that a point lies exactly on the boundary between two countries. Both country records will be included in the query result set, but `LIMIT 1` restricts the result to a single record. 

## Example of API query

The coordinate pair (47,8) can be passed into the function:

`http://localhost:9000/functions/country_by_loc/items.json?lat=47&lon=8`

## Sample JSON response

The service returns data from non-spatial functions in JSON, instead of GeoJSON.

```json
[
    {
        "abbrev":"Switz.",
        "name":"Switzerland",
        "postal":"CH"
    }
]
```
