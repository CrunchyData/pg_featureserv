Functions can be executed to provide sets of features or data.

## Execute a function
The path `/functions/{funid}/items` is the basic query to execute
a function and return the set of features or data it produces.

The response from a _spatial_ function is a GeoJSON feature collection containing the result.
The response from a _non-spatial_ function is a JSON dataset containing the result.

These are similar to using SQL statement clauses to control the results of a query.
In fact, the service implements these parameters by generating the equivalent SQL.
However, these filters are applied to the results
of an executed function, so it doesn't necessarily allow optimizing the
execution of the function. (For example, specifying a bounding box only filters
the results generated by the function; it is not available to the
function to reduce the number of records generated.)

### Function arguments

Functions provide query parameters of the form `param=arg-value`
to provide an argument value for each function parameter.
Omitted parameters use the default specified in the function definition (if any).
If a function parameter does not provide a default
then a value must be supplied.

#### Example
```
http://localhost:9000/functions/countries_name/items?name_prefix=T
```

### Filter by bounding box

The query parameter `bbox=MINX,MINY,MAXX,MAXY`
is used to limit the features returned to those that intersect
a specified bounding box.
The bounding box is specified in geographic coordinates
(longitude/latitude, SRID = 4326).
If the source data has a non-geographic coordinate system
the bounding box is transformed to the source coordinate system
to perform the query.

This parameter is only useful for spatial functions.

#### Example
```
http://localhost:9000/functions/countries_name/items?bbox=10.4,43.3,26.4,47.7
```

### Specify properties

The query parameter `properties=PROP1,PROP2,PROP3...`
specifies the properties returned in the response.
This reduces the response size of functions
that produce a large number of records.

#### Example
```
http://localhost:9000/functions/countries_name/items?properties=name
```

### Limiting and Paging

The query parameter `limit=N` can controls
the maximum number of data items returned in a response.

The query parameter `offset=N` specifies the offset in the
actual query result at which the response data set starts.

When used together, these two parameters allow paging through large result
sets.

#### Example
```
http://localhost:9000/functions/countries_name/items?limit=50&offset=200
```

The default page size and the maximum page size
are set by the [configuration parameters](/installation/configuration/) `LimitDefault` and `LimitMax`.

### Ordering

The result set can be ordered by any property it contains.
This allows performing "greatest N" or "smallest N" queries.

* `orderBy=PROP` orders results by `PROP` in ascending order

The sort order can be specified by appending `:A` (ascending)
or `:D` (descending) to the ordering property name.
The default is ascending order.

* `orderBy=PROP:A` orders results by `PROP` in ascending order
* `orderBy=PROP:D` orders results by `PROP` in descending order

#### Example
```
http://localhost:9000/functions/countries_name/items?orderBy=name
```
