## Notes

* The request response format can be indicated by suffixing URLs with `.json` or `.html`
* Paths are given relative to service root path

## Root

Landing page for the service.

### Request
Path: `/` or `index`

### Response

A JSON document some basic service information
and links to more detailed resources.

#### Links
* self - `/index.json` - This document as JSON
* alternate - `/index.html` - This document as HTML
* conformance
* data - `/collections` - collections
* functions - `/functions` - functions

## Feature collections

List collections provided by the service.

### Request
Path: `/collections`

### Response

JSON document listing service collections.

#### Links
* self - `/collections.json` - This document as JSON
* alternate - `/collections.html` - This document as HTML

## Feature collection

Provides metadata about a feature collection.

### Request
Path: `/collections/{cid}`

### Response

JSON document containing feature collection metadata.

#### Links
* self - `/collections/{cid}.json` - This document as JSON
* alternate - `/collections/{cid}.html` - This document as HTML
* items - `/collections/{cid}/items.json` - Features as GeoJSON
* items - `/collections/{cid}/items.html` - Features as HTML

## Features

Produces a dataset of items from the collection (as GeoJSON)

### Request
Path: `/collections/{cid}/items`

### Parameters
* `bbox=minx,miny,maxx,maxy` - filter features in response to ones intersecting a bounding box (in lon/lat or specified CRS).
* `bbox-crs=SRID` - specify CRS for the `bbox` coordinates
* `<propname>=val` - filter features for a property having a value.
  Multiple property filters are ANDed together.
* `filter=cql-expr` - filters features via a CQL expression
* `filter-crs=SRID` - specifies the CRS for geometry values in the CQL filter
* `transform=fun1[,args][|fun2,args...]` - transform the feature geometry by a geometry function pipeline.
* `groupby=PROP-NAME` - group results on a property.
Usually used with an aggregate `transform` function.
* `properties=PROP-LIST`- return only specific properties (comma-separated).
  If PROP-LIST is empty, no properties are returned.
  If not present, all properties are returned.
* `crs=SRID` - specifies the CRS for the output feature geometry
* `precision=N` - set precision of GeoJSON ordinates to use N decimal places
* `sortby=[+|-]PROP` - sort the response items by a property (ascending (default) or descending).
* `limit=N` - limits the number of features in the response.
* `offset=N` - starts the response at an offset.

### Response

GeoJSON document containing the features resulting from the request query.

#### Links
* self - `/collections/{cid}/items.json` - This document as JSON
* alternate - `/collections/{cid}/items.html` - This document as HTML
* collection - `/collections/{cid}` - The collection document
* next - TBD
* prev - TBD

## Feature

### Request
Path: `/collections/{cid}/items/{fid}`

#### Parameters

* `transform` - transform the feature geometry by the given geometry function pipeline

### Response

#### Links
* self - `/collections/{cid}/items/{fid}.json` - This document as JSON
* alternate - `/collections/{cid}/items/{fid}.html` - This document as HTML
* collection - `/collections/{cid}` - The collection document

## Functions

### Request
Path: `/functions`

### Response

JSON document listing available functions.

#### Links
* self - `/functions.json` - This document as JSON
* alternate - `/functions.html` - This document as HTML

## Function

Provides metadata about a function

## Function Result

Calls a function and produces a result dataset of items (either GeoJSON or JSON).

### Request
Path: `/functions/{fid}/items`

#### Parameters
* `name=value` - Supplies a value for the named function parameter
* `limit=N` - limits the number of features in the response
* `offset=N` - starts the response at the given offset
* `sortby=[+|-]PROP` - sort the response items by a property (ascending (default) or descending).
* `bbox=minx,miny,maxx,maxy` - filter features in response to ones intersecting given bounding box (in lon/lat, for now)
* `properties=PROP-LIST`- return only the given properties (comma-separated)
* `precision=N` - set precision of GeoJSON ordinates to use N decimal places
* `transform` - transform the feature geometry by the given geometry function pipeline
